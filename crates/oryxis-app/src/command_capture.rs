//! Command-history capture: decides, per submitted line of input, whether it
//! was a shell command and what its text was.
//!
//! Three paths, in order of trust:
//!
//! - **In-band** (`OSC 633 ; E`): the shell reports the command line it
//!   actually parsed, so nothing is read off the screen. This is the only
//!   path that works under a multiplexer (inside tmux the app's grid holds
//!   tmux's repaint of every pane, so a vertical split would splice the
//!   neighbouring pane's row into the text), and the only one that cannot
//!   mistake a keystroke for a command. Once a pane sees one `E`, the two
//!   paths below are off for it: they would double-record, and under tmux
//!   the prompt they read may belong to another pane entirely.
//!
//! - **Integrated** (`PromptState::AtPrompt`): input submitted at the prompt
//!   is a command by definition; its text is read back from the grid at the
//!   `PromptEnd` position (so history recall and tab completion come out
//!   right), immediately when the echo is already on screen, or at
//!   `OutputStart` when it isn't yet (paste with a trailing newline). Input
//!   submitted while `Busy` is a running program's stdin, sudo passwords,
//!   `read` answers, and is never recorded. This gate is what makes the
//!   capture safe on integrated hosts: secrets typed mid-command can't
//!   reach the vault by construction.
//!
//! - **Heuristic** (`PromptState::NoIntegration`): the line the cursor sits
//!   on must contain a classic prompt marker (`$ `, `# `, ...), and the text
//!   after the marker must match the input-tracker mirror (proof the input
//!   was echoed, so not a password). A tainted mirror (history recall, tab
//!   completion) trusts the echoed grid text instead. No marker, or no echo,
//!   means no record: this path prefers missing a command over recording a
//!   secret or garbage.
//!
//! Both paths honor the `HISTCONTROL=ignorespace` convention: a command
//! starting with a space is deliberately not recorded.
